			<p> "I am a positive and outgoing individual who loves to learn. I take on challenges with passion and I am constantly looking to grow &#38; expand my horizons. One of the things I value the most is respect. I believe respect for everyone &#38; everything is fundamental." </p>

			<p> "Most recently, my journey led me to NPower Canada, where I went through an intensive program learning web &#38; mobile application development. I have learned HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Java, OOP concepts, Android app development, AGILE &#38; SCRUM methodologies, and much more. I am also now MTA certified (Microsoft Technology Associate), and look forward to getting more certifications." </p>
